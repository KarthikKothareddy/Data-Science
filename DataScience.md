# Notes on Data Science

## Big Data
* It is a bundle of technologies
* Second, it is a potential revolution in measurement
* And third, it is a point of view, or philosophy, about how decisions will be and perhaps should be made in the future

## Statistical Inference
* The World: The world we live in is complex, random, and uncertain. At the same time, it’s one big data-generating machine
* Collecting the data: Turn the world into data, and this is an utterly subjective, not objective, process
* Uncertainty: The randomness and uncertainty underlying the process itself, and the uncertainty associated with your underlying data collection methods
* Statistical estimators / Modeling: A new idea, and that’s to simplify those captured traces into something more comprehensible, to something that somehow captures it all in a much more concise way
* The overall process of going from the world to the data, and then from the data back to the world, is the field of statistical inference

## Terminology
* Population: Set of all possible inputs
* Observation: One input
* Sample: A subset of population

## Various kinds of Data
* Traditional: numerical, categorical, or binary
* Text: emails, tweets, New York Times articles
* Records: user-level data, timestamped event data, json-formatted log files
* Geo-based location data: NYC housing data
* Network
* Sensor data
* Images

## Model
* A model is an artificial construction where all extraneous detail has been removed or abstracted
* A model is our attempt to understand and represent the nature of reality through a particular lens, be it architectural, biological, or mathematical

## Machine Learning
* Machine learning algorithms are largely used to predict, classify, or cluster
* Many business or real-world problems that can be solved with data can be thought of as classification and prediction problems when we express them mathematically

### Vocabulary
* Interpreting parameters
* Confidence intervals
* The role of explicit assumptions

### Linear Regression

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


## Questions
* Linear Regression: So Is It an Algorithm or a Model?
